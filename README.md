# London Population Growth Analysis

## Overview
This project delves into the analysis of London's population growth, showcasing advanced data mining techniques and meticulous data preparation to extract meaningful insights. Through comprehensive data analysis, this work aims to highlight trends, challenges, and potential forecasts regarding London's demographic changes.

## Project Structure
Contained within this repository is a Jupyter notebook (`Analysis Population Growth Rate-Marizeek Mabifa.ipynb`), which serves as the cornerstone of the project. While this notebook is code-intensive, it represents a sophisticated journey through various stages of data analysis, specifically:

- Data Mining: Demonstrating the ability to gather data from multiple sources, this section details the processes and tools used to collect data relevant to London's population.
- Data Preparation: A critical showcase of preparing raw data to a form that is suitable for analysis. This involves cleaning, transforming, and structuring the data to ensure accuracy and relevance for the analysis.
- Analysis: With the data prepared, this section dives into the exploration of London's population growth, utilizing statistical methods and visualization techniques to draw insights and identify patterns.


## Technologies Used
- Python: The core language used for conducting data analysis.
- Libraries: Utilization of Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computations, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizing the data.
